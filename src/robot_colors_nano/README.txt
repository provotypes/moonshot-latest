This directory holds an Arduino NANO sketch (program) to 
drive the NeoPixel LED's on the 2022 FRC robot, Team 6844.

This is NOT Java code, and it will NOt be built with the
WPILib toolchain.

The code in this directory assumes a target of an Atmel/Microchip
ATmega328 Nano version 3.0, with the older bootloader.

This code was compiled by version 1.8.19 of the Arduino IDE.  It
is the most recent stable version as of Jan 24, 2022, and can be
downloaded for Windows 64-bit computers here:

    https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-1.8.19-windows.exe

The above installer includes a USB driver compatible with the
usb chip on the Nano.
